# return â†’ Exit from a function
# Stops the function immediately and optionally sends a value back to the caller.

# It can be used inside loops too â€” but only if the loop is inside a function.

# What it does: Immediately stops the function and sends a value back to the caller.

# Where it works: only inside a function.



# Example of using return in a function
