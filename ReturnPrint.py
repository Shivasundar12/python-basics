# 🔥 RETURN vs PRINT: The Ultimate Showdown!
# Let's Understand with a FOOD DELIVERY Analogy! 🍕
# 🛵 PRINT is like a Food Delivery Guy who...
# Shows you the food (displays it)
# But doesn't give it to you to keep
# Once shown, it's gone!
# 📦 RETURN is like a Food Delivery Guy who...
# Gives you the package (returns the value)
# You can keep it and use it later
# You can store it, reuse it, or give it to someone else!

# Example 1: Simple Function (Like a Calculator)
def add(a,b):
    print(a + b)  # This prints the result but doesn't return it
result = add(3,4)
print("Result from print function:", result)  # This will print None because add() doesn't return anything
